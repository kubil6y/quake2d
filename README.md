# Quake2D

-   [Gameplay in engine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8BzNgMHqMk)
- 	Will playable on itch very soon!

This is my first Unity game. Most of the assets can be found in Unity store. I have used this old gem [The BloodCrafter - Minecraft 2D Shooter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=coBzHfkvI8w) as inspiration.

I mainly used two design patterns in this game.

1. [State Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine)
2. [Object Pooling (native implentation)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_pool_pattern)
